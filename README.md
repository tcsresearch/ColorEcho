Update 06/15/2024: A NewCecho.bfunc has been added which may supercede our original code. It is far simpler and appears to work, but requires further testing and some new features. The main drawback is loss of ability to use multiple colors on the same line.

There may be a best of both worlds option.  If we have NewCecho.bfunc become our new core code and the original code become AdvancedCecho.bfunc or AdvCecho.bfunc, we could call the ability to use multiple colors on the same line when needed and everything else will use the NewCecho code for simplicity.

Another feature in the original code is more colors, flashing colors, etc.
